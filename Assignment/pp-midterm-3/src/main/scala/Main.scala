/** Principles of Programming: Midterm problem 3.
  *
  * Implement given functions, which are currently left blank. (???) **WARNING:
  * Please read the restrictions below carefully.**
  *
  * If you do not follow these, **your submission will not be graded.**
  *
  *   - Do not use the keyword `var`. Use `val` and `def` instead.
  *   - Do not use any library functions or data structures like `List`,
  *     `Array`, `Range` (`1 to n`, `1 until n` ...), `fold`, `map`, `reduce` or
  *     etc.
  *   - If you want to use a data structure, create new one instead of using the
  *     library ones.
  *   - You can only use tuples, `scala.annotation.tailrec`, and
  *     `scala.util.control.TailCalls._` from the library.
  *   - Do not use any looping syntax of Scala (`for`, `while`, `do-while`,
  *     `yield`, ...)
  *
  * Again, your score will be zero if you do not follow these rules.
  *
  * We do not require tail-recursion explicitly for the midterm except problem 2.
  *
  * Timeout: 30 sec.
