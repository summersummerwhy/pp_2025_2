/** Principles of Programming: Assignment 01.
  *
  * Implement the given functions, which are currently left blank. (???)
  *
  * **WARNING:Please read the restrictions below carefully.**
  * If you do not follow these, **your submission will not be graded.**
  *
  *   - Do not use the keyword `var`. Use `val` and `def` instead.
  *   - Do not use any library functions or data structures like `List`,
  *     `Array`, `Range` (`1 to n`, `1 until n`, ...), `fold`, `map`, `reduce` etc.
  *   - You may only use tuples, `scala.annotation.tailrec`,
  *     `scala.util.control.TailCalls._` from the library.
  *   - Do not use any looping syntax of Scala (`for`, `while`, `do-while`,
  *     `yield`, etc.).
  *
  * Again, your score will be zero if you do not follow these rules.
  *
  * Note that these rules will be gradually relaxed in future assignments.
  *
  * For problems except problem 1-1, some test cases will require 
  * optimizations (i.e., large inputs) including tail call optimizations 
  * and the others will not (i.e., small inputs).
  * 
  * So, you will get partial point if you submit a correct program
  * without proper optimizations.
  * 
  * See /src/test/scala/TestSuite.scala for some test cases (grading will be done based on more testcases).
